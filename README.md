**What... is this thing?**

At a point, I was very disappointed by Mac OS X.  
There was no out-of-the-box application like Sticky notes on Windows.
So I started learning Swift programming and  aimed to create a REALLY simple application for Mac to keep my instant notes.

My aim was putting a tiny icon on taskbar and when I click it will be showing a rough page to paste last thing I copied to my clipboard.

Mirabilis came out of this basic need. Still I cannot find a suitable option.  

Maybe someday in the future I continue coding this project.  

Till that day, let me keep its code here. (I bet it won't work but anyway I don't want to throw it to garbage ☺️)
